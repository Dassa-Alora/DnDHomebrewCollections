*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

The Kwajit Slavers of Taryn created this clever little bomb to keep the slaves they sell in line with their masters. The Kwajit Slavers would force the slaves they were selling to ingest the lentil-sized bomb. After a month or two, the bomb would then "fuse" with the slave's body making it impossible to be remove.

The masters of Kwajit slaves would receive either a remote detonator or a range detonator. If the Purple Worm Bomb has a remote detonator, then the master can detonator the bomb regardless of the slave's location. The bombs that have a remote detonator is much more expensive then the bombs that have a range detonator. If the Purple Worm Bomb has a ranged detonator, then the slave can't be a certain distance away from their master, otherwise the bomb inside them would detonate automatically. 

If a player has ingested a Purple Worm Bomb, when it detonates they must make a **DC 19 Constitution Save**. If the player **fails** the DC Constitution Save, then they will take **8d4 Piercing Damage** and **12d6 Poison Damage**. If the player succeeds on the DC Constitution Save, then they will take **half that damage**.
