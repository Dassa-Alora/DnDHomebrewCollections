# Warlock Subclass: The Quori

Your patron is that of the Quori, rulers of Dal Quor the Region of Dreams. You may have made a pact with the Quori in your dreams while you slept. Or perhaps a Quori Spirit has been within you all this time. Either way, the Quori within you may have the desire to bring about a nightmarish kingdom upon the world or it may have the desire to protect the world from the darkness of Dal Quor using you as their host.
